action = store

default =
type = str

default =
type = str
metavar = token
nargs = 1

If the -m/--local-mode flag is used, then this should instead be a full path to the parent directory of an asset living somewhere on disk. Note: do NOT include the asset name itself in this path. See the -m/--local-mode flag for more details.

[options-version]
short_flag = -v
long_flag = --version
action = store
dest = version
default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the version you wish to set keywords on (in the format v####). Example: v0001. If omitted, then the latest version will be used.
