[description]

[usage]
%(prog)s <path to the asset> [options]

[options-asset_path]
short_flag = asset_path
long_flag =
action = store
dest =
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_path
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The path to the asset that contains the versions you wish to set or delete metadata on.

[options-version]
short_flag = -v
long_flag = --version
action = store
dest = version
default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the version you wish to set metadata on (in the format v####). Example: v0001. If omitted, then the latest version will be used.

[options-metadata]
short_flag = -m
long_flag = --metadata
action = store
dest = metadata
default =
type = str
metavar = metadata
nargs = +
required = False
description = An unlimited number of key=value pairs of arbitrary metadata to add to the publish. This would be given in the format: -m key1=value1 key2=value2 ... keyN=valueN. Note that there are no spaces between the key and the value. If you want the metadata to have spaces in it, use quotes to enclose the value. The key should not have spaces. If for some reason you must have spaces in the key, enclose the key in quotes as well.

[options-delete]
short_flag = -d
long_flag = --delete
action = store
dest = delete
default =
type = str
metavar = delete
nargs = +
required = False
description = An unlimited number of metadata keys to delete from the version. This would be given in the format: -d metadata_key1 metadata_key2 ... metadata_keyN. If your keys have spaces in them (not really a good idea by the way), use quotes to enclose them here.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
