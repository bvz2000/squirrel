[description]
Sets or deletes metadata for a specific version in an asset. If no version is offered, then the latest version will automatically be used. Versions are always given in the format "v####" (for example, "v0001"). Metadata is given with the -m option (as many as needed).

[usage]
%(prog)s <asset name> <token> [options]

[options-asset_name]
short_flag = asset_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = asset_name
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_name
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name the asset that contains the metadata you wish to add or delete to/from.

[options-token]
short_flag = token
long_flag =
action = store
dest = token
default =
type = str
metavar = token
nargs = 1
required = True
description = A token (relative path to an asset from within a repo). If the -m/--local-mode flag is used, then this should instead be a full path to the parent directory of an asset living somewhere on disk. Note: do NOT include the asset name itself in this path. See the -m/--local-mode flag for more details.

[options-version]
short_flag = -v
long_flag = --version
action = store
dest = version
default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the version you wish to set metadata on (in the format v####). Example: v0001. If omitted, then the latest version will be used.

[options-metadata]
short_flag = -M
long_flag = --metadata
action = store
dest = metadata
default =
type = str
metavar = metadata
nargs = +
required = False
description = An unlimited number of key=value pairs of arbitrary metadata to add to the publish. This would be given in the format: -m key1=value1 key2=value2 ... keyN=valueN. Note that there are no spaces between the key and the value. If you want the metadata to have spaces in it, use quotes to enclose the value. The key should not have spaces. If for some reason you must have spaces in the key, enclose the key in quotes as well.

[options-delete]
short_flag = -d
long_flag = --delete
action = store
dest = delete
default =
type = str
metavar = delete
nargs = +
required = False
description = An unlimited number of metadata keys to delete from the version. This would be given in the format: -d metadata_key1 metadata_key2 ... metadata_keyN. If your keys have spaces in them (not really a good idea by the way), use quotes to enclose them here.

[options-repo]
short_flag = -r
long_flag = --repo
action = store
dest = repo
default =
type = str
metavar = repo
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the repo that contains the asset you are setting or deleting a metadata in. This may be left blank if you wish to use the default repo, or if you are setting or deleting metadata in a random asset on disk that is not being managed by Squirrel.

[options-local_mode]
short_flag = -m
long_flag = --local-mode
action = store_true
dest = local_mode
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs = 1
required = False
description = If the asset you wish to edit metadata on is not managed by Squirrel, and is merely an asset on disk somewhere, you may use this flag to indicate this. This means the token you supply should instead be a full path to the PARENT directory in which the asset lives.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
