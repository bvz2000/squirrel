[usage]
%(prog)s <asset name> <token> [options]

[options-asset_name]
short_flag = asset_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = asset_name
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_name
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name the asset that contains the versions you wish to add thumbnails to.

[options-token]
short_flag = token
long_flag =
action = store
dest = token
default =
type = str
metavar = token
nargs = 1
required = True
description = A token (relative path to an asset from within a repo). If the -m/--local-mode flag is used, then this should instead be a full path to the parent directory of an asset living somewhere on disk. Note: do NOT include the asset name itself in this path. See the -m/--local-mode flag for more details.

[options-version]
short_flag = -v
long_flag = --version
action = store
dest = version
default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the version you wish to add thumbnails to (in the format v####). Example: v0001. If omitted, then the latest version will be used.

[options-thumbnails]
short_flag = -t
long_flag = --thumbnails
action = store
dest = thumbnails
default =
type = str
metavar = thumbnails
nargs = 1
required = False
description = A list of thumbnail files using a standard frame range notation (ex: thumbs.1-180.png). These files MUST conform to the following naming convention: <asset_name>.#.<ext>  where the <asset_name> matches the name of the asset. # is a frame number (you may use any amount of padding desired). You must include a frame number even if it is only a single file. <ext> is the file name extension.

[options-merge]
short_flag = -M
long_flag = --no-merge
action = store_true
dest = nomerge
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Remove all existing thumbnails and replace them with the new thumbnails. If omitted, then the new thumbnails will only overwrite any thumbnails with the same frame numbers, leaving others in place. Use this option if you want to completely replace any previous thumbnails and your frame range for your new thumbnails does not completely encompass the previous range of thumbnails.

[options-poster_frame]
short_flag = -P
long_flag = --poster-frame
action = store
dest = poster_frame
default =
type = int
metavar = frame
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Frame number of thumbnail to use as the poster image. If padding is required, use quotes around the frame number. If omitted, the first frame will be used as the poster frame.

[options-repo]
short_flag = -r
long_flag = --repo
action = store
dest = repo
default =
type = str
metavar = repo
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the repo that contains the asset you are adding thumbnails to. This may be left blank if you wish to use the default repo, or if you are setting or deleting keywords in a random asset on disk that is not being managed by Squirrel.

[options-local_mode]
short_flag = -m
long_flag = --local-mode
action = store_true
dest = local_mode
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs = 1
required = False
description = If the asset you wish to thumbnails to is not managed by Squirrel, and is merely an asset on disk somewhere, you may use this flag to indicate this. This means the token you supply should instead be a full path to the PARENT directory in which the asset lives.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
