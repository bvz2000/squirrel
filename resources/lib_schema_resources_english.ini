100=There are no repos currently added to the system. They may already exist on disk, but the system is not aware of them. Use schema-config to add these repos, or use schema-bless to create new repos.
101=The repo you are trying to make default ({{COLOR_RED}}{repo_name}{{COLOR_NONE}}) has not yet been added to the system.\n\nIt might exist on disk, but it would need to be added using amRepo-manage.\nAlternatively, use amRepo-bless to create the new repo first.
102=The repo ({{COLOR_RED}}{repo_name}{{COLOR_NONE}}) does not exist in the system. It may exist on disk, but it needs to be added to the system first.
103=No default repo has been defined, and no specific repo has been provided.
200=The path {root_path} is not actually a repo root path. It is missing a hidden file called .repo_root.
400=The path ({path}) does not exist.
401=The path ({path}) is not a directory.
601=A repository with the name {repo} already exists (currently located at: {path}).
602=You cannot create a new repo inside of an already existing repo. The repo you are trying to create ({{COLOR_RED}}{path}{{COLOR_NONE}}) is inside of an existing repo ({{COLOR_RED}}{repo}{{COLOR_NONE}}).
603=A non-root directory may only be added to an existing repo. The dir you are trying to bless ({{COLOR_RED}}path{{COLOR_NONE}}) is not inside of a repo.

102=The config file is corrupted. It is missing the option: {missing_option}
103=Unable to locate the application config directory {config_dir}. Check the (optional) SQUIRREL_CONFIG env variable? Otherwise, it should be in a directory called 'resources' that is in the same directory where this app lives.

500={{COLOR_RED}}You have not set up any repos yet.{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nPerhaps you have not set up the squirrel.ini file to point to the repos? (This file is currently being read from {squirrel_ini}).\n\nOptionally, you could also set up the {root_env_var} env variable to point to the different repos. Regardless of method, any repos you define_options will need to exist on disk and have "blessed" directories in them. See the documentation for more details.
600=The repository ({repo}) does not exist. Please select from the following repos: {repos}
601=A repository with the name {repo} already exists (currently located at: {path}).
602=You are trying to bless a repo that already has been blessed with a different name (currently this directory has been blessed as a repo named: {repo}).

800=Cannot create a repo inside of another repo. The path passed ({path}) is inside of the repo: {repo}.
801=You cannot create a Squirrel repository structure directory that isn't inside of a repo. See the documentation for more information.
900=The asset name has multiple underscores adjacent to each other and not separated by other text (i.e. something like this: __). This is not allowed.

902=The asset name is missing the repository (it must begin with one of the following: {repo_list})
903=The asset name begins with a valid repository, but that is not the repository that was passed into the system. The repository being used is: {actual_repo}, but the repository in the name is {name_repo}.
904=The asset name is missing some of its tokens. At the very minimum it should start with one of the following: {possible_next}
905=The asset name is missing some of its tokens. At the very minimum, after "{up_to_last_item}" there should be one of the following: {possible_next}
906=The asset name is missing a description. It should have a descriptive item in the name in after "{up_to_last_item}"
950=Metadata being passed by the user contains two or more items with the same key. ({key})
1000=Wrong number of arguments.
1001=You must supply a name for the repository. Use the -l/--list-repos option to list available repos. Use the --set-default-repo option to set a default repo (after which you will not be required to supply a repo on the command line).
1002=You must supply a name for the repository. Use the -l/--list-repos option to list available repos.
1100=Your system is set up to not require the asset name to contain metadata. Because of this you need to provide the metadata about the asset. This data is missing.
