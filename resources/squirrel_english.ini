list_assets_keywords_optional_helpstr={{COLOR_BRIGHT_BLUE}}OPTIONAL{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nA space delimited list of keywords to filter the assets on. For example:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-k low_poly western grubby{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nwould limit the resulting assets to only those that have ANY of the preceding keywords. Use the --keywords-and (-a) option to return assets that have ALL of the preceding keywords. For example\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-a -k low_poly western grubby{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nwould only return assets that match ALL of the preceding keywords. All matches are case insensitive.\n\n
list_assets_metadata_keys_optional_helpstr={{COLOR_BRIGHT_BLUE}}OPTIONAL{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nA space delimited list of metadata KEYS to filter the assets on. Any metadata values associated with these keys are ignored.

Example:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-M "polycount>1000" "shaded=true"{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nUse the --metadata-and (-A) option to return assets that have ALL of the preceding metadata keys AND values (the default behavior is to match ANY of the preceding metadata keys AND values).\n\nAll matches are case insensitive.\n\n
list_assets_keyword_and_optional_helpstr=\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_BLUE}}OPTIONAL{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nUse this option to force the keyword filtering to use the AND comparison operator. By default keywords filtering is done using the OR comparison operator (i.e. any keyword match would result in a matched asset). Using this operator forces these comparisons to be carried out using the AND comparison (i.e. all keywords would have to match). Note: different filter types (tokens, keywords, metadata) are ALWAYS performed as AND comparisons with regard to each other. I.e. if you supply both keywords and metadata, both will have to match (regardless of their individual AND/OR settings) in order for the resulting asset to be included.\n\n
list_assets_metadata_and_optional_helpstr=\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_BLUE}}OPTIONAL{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nUse this option to force the metadata filtering to use the AND comparison operator. By default metadata filtering is done using the OR comparison operator (i.e. any metadata key AND value match would result in a matched asset). Using this operator forces these comparisons to be carried out using the AND comparison (i.e. all metadata keys AND values would have to match). Note: different filter types (tokens, keywords, metadata) are ALWAYS performed as AND comparisons with regard to each other. I.e. if you supply both keywords and metadata, both will have to match (regardless of their individual AND/OR settings) in order for the resulting asset to be included.\n\n

These characters are:\n\n    n -> Display the name\n    p -> Display the path\n    u -> Display the URI\n    U -> Display the URI path\n    k -> Display the keywords\n    m -> Display the metadata\n    N -> Display the latest notes\n    t -> Display the thumbnail paths\n    v -> Display the versions\n    V -> Display the latest version\n    P -> Display the pins\n\nYou may add these characters in any order to control the order in which the data id displayed. If omitted, only a subset of these fields will be displayed (Normally this is the name, path, URI, and latest version but the actual set of default fields is controlled by the config file).\n\nFor example, display every field in the order the characters are listed:\n\n    {{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-f puUkmNtvVP{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\n

This URI should be in the format:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}repo_name://path/to/asset#asset_name{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nIf no URI's are provided, then all keywords in the default repo will be returned.\n\nPartial URI's are also allowed as long as they conform to the following rules:\n\n1) Repo name is optional\nThe repo name (the portion before the :/) may be omitted. If omitted, the default repo will be used. This default repo must be set and valid.\n\n2) Path is optional.\nThe path (the portion after the :/) may be omitted, or only a partial path included. If only a partial path is included then it may only be missing elements from the end. All keywords from assets that are children of this path will be returned.\n\n3) Asset names are optional.\nAsset names (the portion after the #) may be omitted. If an asset name is included, then the results will be limited to just the keywords on that asset.\n\nExamples:\n\n1) All keywords in "myrepo":\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-u myrepo:/{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\n2) All keywords from the assets in "myrepo" that are children of the veh category:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-u myrepo://assets/veh{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\n3) All keywords from the assets in the default repo that are children of the veg/tree category:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-u /assets/veg/tree{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\n4) All the keywords from a specific asset:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}-u myrepo://asset/veg/tree#oak_A{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\n

add_keywords_uri_required_helpstr=\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_RED}}REQUIRED{{COLOR_NONE}}\nA URI (or list of URI's) to identify the repo and/or path (optional), and the asset name (required) for the asset(s) on to which keywords should be added. You may supply multiple URI's in order to affect more than one asset. This URI should be in the format:\n\n{{COLOR_BRIGHT_YELLOW}}repo_name://path/to/asset#asset_name{{COLOR_NONE}}\n\nPartial URI's are also allowed as long as they conform to the following rules:\n\n1) Repo name is optional\nThe repo name (the portion before the :/) may be omitted. If omitted, the default repo will be used. This default repo must be set and valid.\n\n2) Path is optional.\nThe path (the portion after the :/) may be omitted, or only a partial path included. If only a partial path is included then it may only be missing elements from the end. If a partial URI would lead to more than one asset being returned, an error is raised. To rectify this, supply a more specific URI path.\n\n3) Asset names are required.\nAsset names (the portion after the #) must be supplied. If an asset name is not unique, and no URI path (or only a partial URI path) is supplied, chances are the system will refuse to return any notes and instead will inform you of an error.
