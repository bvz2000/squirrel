[description]
Sets a named pin that points to a specific version in an asset. Versions are always given in the format "v####" (for example, "v0001"). Pins may be any string of characters, though it is best to avoid characters that may confuse file-systems (such as leading dots, the / or \ characters, quotes, etc.). The only reserved pin name (a pin that you cannot set manually) is "LATEST". All pin names will be converted to uppercase. If you give a pin name that already exists, that pin will then be re-directed to point to the version you gave as a part of this command. If you do not wish to be warned of this situation, use the -w (or --no-warn) option.

[options-asset_path]
short_flag = asset_path
long_flag =
action = store
dest =
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_path
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The path to the asset that contains the versions you wish to pin to.

[options-version]
short_flag = version
long_flag =
action = store

default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1

description = The name of the version you wish to pin to (in the format v####). Example: v0001

[options-pin_name]
short_flag = pin_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = dest
default =
type = str
metavar = pin_name
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the pin you wish to create. Best to avoid characters that may confuse file-systems (such as leading dots, the / or \ characters, quotes, etc.) You may not use the pin name "LATEST" as it is reserved for the system. All pin names will be converted to uppercase. If a pin name has already been set, this command will redirect it to point to the new version. If you do not wish to be warned in these situations, use the -w (or --no-warn) option.

[options-no_warn]
short_flag = -w
long_flag = --no-warn
action = store_true
dest = no_warn
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Disable warnings if a pin already exists and this action might change it to point to a new version.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
