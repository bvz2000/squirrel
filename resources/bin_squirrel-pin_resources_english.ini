[description]
Sets or deletes a named pin that points to a specific version in an asset. Versions are always given in the format "v####" (for example, "v0001"). Pins may be any string of characters, though it is best to avoid characters that may confuse file-systems (such as leading dots, the / or \ characters, quotes, etc.). The only reserved pin name (a pin that you cannot set manually) is "LATEST". You may not delete any pins that are named "latest" or "current". All pin names will be converted to uppercase. If you give a pin name that already exists, that pin will then be re-directed to point to the version you gave as a part of this command.

[usage]
%(prog)s <asset name> <asset token or path> <version to pin to> <pin name> [options]

[options-asset_name]
short_flag = asset_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = asset_name
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_name
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name the asset that contains the versions you wish to pin to.

[options-token]
short_flag = token
long_flag =
action = store
dest = token
default =
type = str
metavar = token
nargs = 1
required = True
description = A token (relative path to an asset from within a repo). If the -m/--local-mode flag is used, then this should instead be a full path to the parent directory of an asset living somewhere on disk. Note: do NOT include the asset name itself in this path. See the -m/--local-mode flag for more details.

[options-version]
short_flag = version
long_flag =
action = store
dest = version
default =
type = str
metavar = version
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name of the version you wish to pin to (in the format v####). Example: v0001

[options-pin_name]
short_flag = pin_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = pin_name
default =
type = str
metavar = pin_name
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name of the pin you wish to create. Best to avoid characters that may confuse file-systems (such as leading dots, the / or \ characters, quotes, etc.) You may not use the pin name "LATEST" as it is reserved for the system. All pin names will be converted to uppercase. If a pin name has already been set, this command will redirect it to point to the new version.

[options-repo]
short_flag = -r
long_flag = --repo
action = store
dest = repo
default =
type = str
metavar = repo
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the repo that contains the asset you are setting or deleting a pin in. This may be left blank if you wish to use the default repo, or if you are managing a pin for a random asset on disk that is not being managed by Squirrel.

[options-local_mode]
short_flag = -m
long_flag = --local-mode
action = store_true
dest = local_mode
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs = 1
required = False
description = If the asset you wish to change a pin on is not managed by Squirrel, and is merely an asset on disk somewhere, you may use this flag to indicate this. This means the token you supply should instead be a full path to the PARENT directory in which the asset lives.

[options-delete]
short_flag = -d
long_flag = --delete
action = store_true
dest = delete
default = False
type = bool
metavar = delete
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Set this flag to delete the pin instead of creating it. You may not delete the "LATEST" or "CURRENT" pins. You must still enter the version that the pin points to (as a safety measure).

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
