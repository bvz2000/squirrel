[usage]
%(prog)s <asset name> <asset token or path> [options]

[options-asset_name]
short_flag = asset_name
long_flag =
action = store
dest = asset_name
default =
type = str
metavar = asset_name
nargs = 1
required = True
description = The name the asset that you wish to collapse.

[options-token]
short_flag = token
long_flag =
action = store
dest = token
default =
type = str
metavar = token
nargs = 1
required = True
description = A token (relative path to an asset from within a repo). If the -m/--local-mode flag is used, then this should instead be a full path to the parent directory of an asset living somewhere on disk. Note: do NOT include the asset name itself in this path. See the -m/--local-mode flag for more details.

[options-remove_pins]
short_flag = -p
long_flag = --remove-pins
action = store_true
dest = remove_pins
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = If used, this flag will automatically delete any pins that point to versions that are being deleted. The "CURRENT" pin will be reassigned to point to the latest version. If you do not use this option, then an error will be raised if any of the versions to be deleted have pins pointing to them.

[options-repo]
short_flag = -r
long_flag = --repo
action = store
dest = repo
default =
type = str
metavar = repo
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The name of the repo that contains the asset you are collapsing. This may be left blank if you wish to use the default repo, or if you are collapsing a random asset on disk that is not being managed by Squirrel.

[options-local_mode]
short_flag = -m
long_flag = --local-mode
action = store_true
dest = local_mode
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs = 1
required = False
description = If the asset you wish to collapse is not managed by Squirrel, and is merely an asset on disk somewhere, you may use this flag to indicate this. This means the token you supply should instead be a full path to the PARENT directory in which the asset lives.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
