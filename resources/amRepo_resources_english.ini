[options-list_repos]
short_flag = -L
long_flag = --list-repos
action = store_true
dest = list_repos
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Lists all of the repositories the system knows about. This is essentially just a list of the repos in the config file. There may be additional repositories on disk that are not currently defined in the config file. This will also indicate which repositories listed in the config file may be broken, and which repository is the default repository.

[options-remove_broken_repos]
short_flag = -B
long_flag = --remove-broken-repos
action = store_true
dest = remove_broken_repos
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = If there are any broken repositories stored in the config file, this will remove them from the config. Note: NO ACTUAL FILES ON DISK ARE CHANGED OR DELETED. ONLY THE CONFIG IS ALTERED TO REMOVE ANY REFERENCE TO THE BROKEN REPOSITORIES.

[options-set_default]
short_flag = -D
long_flag = --set-default-repository
action = store
dest = set_default_repository
default =
type = str
metavar = name
nargs =
required = False
description = Given the name of an existing repository, makes that repository the default.

[options-add_repository]
short_flag = -A
long_flag = --add-repository
action = store
dest = add_repository
default =
type = str
metavar = name
nargs =
required = False
description = Given a path to an existing repository, adds that repository to the list of available repositories in the config.

[options-remove_repository]
short_flag = -R
long_flag = --remove-repository
action = store
dest = remove_repository
default =
type = str
metavar = name
nargs =
required = False
description = Given the name of an existing repository, removes that repository from the config file. Note: NO ACTUAL FILES ON DISK ARE CHANGED OR DELETED. ONLY THE CONFIG IS ALTERED TO REMOVE ANY REFERENCE TO THE REPOSITORY BEING REMOVED.

[options-bless_tree]
short_flag = -t
long_flag = --bless-tree
action = store
dest = bless_tree
default = ""
type = str
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Bless the associated directory and (nearly) all of its sub-directories as a new repository. The path given will be the root of the tree, and (nearly) every subdirectory will become part of the repo structure. The only sub-directories that will not be made into part of the repository structure are any existing sub-directories that are already assets. If the path given is within an existing repo, an error is raised. Automatically disables -r/--bless-root and -d/--bless-dir if they are also included.

[options-bless_root]
short_flag = -r
long_flag = --bless-root
action = store
dest = bless_root
default = ""
type = str
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Bless the associated directory as the root of a repository. If the path given is within an existing repo, an error is raised. Automatically disables -d/--bless-dir if is is also included.

[options-bless_dir]
short_flag = -d
long_flag = --bless-dir
action = store
dest = bless_dir
default = ""
type = str
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = Bless the associated directory as a structure directory within an existing repository. If the path given is not within an existing repo, an error is raised.

[options-name]
short_flag = -n
long_flag = --name
action = store
dest = name
default =
type = str
metavar = name
nargs = 1
required = False
description = If blessing a root directory or an entire tree, this is an optional name to give the repository. If omitted, the name will be taken from the name of the source directory. Only relevant if the -r (--bless-root) or -t (--bless-tree) options are also given.

[options-language]
short_flag = -l
long_flag = --language
action = store
dest = language
default = english
type = str
metavar = language
nargs = 1
required = False
description = Use this language. If none given, or if the language is not installed, defaults to 'english'.
