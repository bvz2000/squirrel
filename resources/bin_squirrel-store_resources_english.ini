action = store
dest =
default =
type = str
metavar = source
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The source file or directory you wish to store.

[options-destination]
short_flag = destination
long_flag =
action = store
dest = dest
default =
type = str
metavar = destination
nargs = 1
required = False
description = The destination directory where you want the file(s) stored.

[options-name]
short_flag = -N
long_flag = --name
action = store
dest = name
default =
type = str
metavar = name
nargs = 1
required = False

type = str
metavar = metadata
nargs = +
required = False
description = An unlimited number of key=value pairs of arbitrary metadata to add to the publish. This would be given in the format: -m key1=value1 key2=value2 ... keyN=valueN. Note that there are no spaces between the key and the value. If you want the metadata to have spaces in it, use quotes to enclose the value. The key should not have spaces. If for some reason you must have spaces in the key, enclose the key in quotes as well. This data will be stored with the metadata for the version being published.

[options-keywords]
short_flag = -k
long_flag = --keywords
action = store
dest = keywords
default =
type = str
metavar = keywords
nargs = +

You must include a frame number even if it is only a single file. <ext> is the file name extension.

[options-poster]
short_flag = -P
long_flag = --poster-frame
action = store
dest = poster_frame
default =
type = int
metavar = frame
nargs = 1

description = Optional poster frame number when supplying thumbnails. Only relevant if supplying thumbnails.

[options-merge]
short_flag = -M
long_flag = --no-merge
action = store_true
dest = nomerge
default = False
type = bool
metavar =
nargs =
required = False
description = If used, this flag will prevent any previously published files from migrating to the latest published version. Use if you want a "fresh" publish with no legacy files in it.

nargs =
required = False
