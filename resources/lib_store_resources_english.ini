[error_codes]
100=The version you are trying to delete ({{COLOR_RED}}{version}{{COLOR_NONE}}) does not exist.
101=The metadata for the version you are trying to delete ({{COLOR_RED}}{metadata}{{COLOR_NONE}}) does not exist.
102=The version you are trying to delete ({{COLOR_RED}}{version}{{COLOR_NONE}}) cannot be deleted because it is being referenced by the pin ({{COLOR_RED}}{pin}{{COLOR_NONE}}). Reset or delete that pin before continuing.
103=Asset has too many revisions. The max is 9999.
104=The .metadata directory in the asset ({{COLOR_RED}}{metadir}{{COLOR_NONE}}) is not a symlink. It should be though. Stopping now because this implies that something has gone rather wrong here.
105=Unable to reserve a slot for the asset version {asset_name} after {num_attempts} attempts.
106=The thumbnail file ({thumbnail_file}) does not conform to the required naming convention. It should be named {basename}.#.ext where "#" represents a frame number (required, even if there is only a single thumbnail file), and "ext" is any valid image file format extension (like png or jpg etc).
107=The thumbnail you are trying to carry forward ({{COLOR_RED}}{thumbnail_file}{{COLOR_NONE}}) is not a symlink. Cannot continue.
108=The pin you are trying to delete ({pin}) is actually a file or directory. It is not a symlink. Out of an abundance of caution, this item will NOT be deleted.
109=The frame you are trying to make into a poster ({{COLOR_RED}}{frame}{{COLOR_NONE}}) does not exist. Expected to find a file that begins with the text: {{COLOR_RED}}{thumbnail_file}{{COLOR_NONE}} and has an extension of .jpg or .png or .exr or something along those lines (any extension is acceptable).
110=The copy failed to verify. This means that the source file you copied ({{COLOR_RED}}{source}{{COLOR_NONE}}) and its copy ({{COLOR_RED}}{copy}{{COLOR_NONE}}) do not match. Some data corruption has occurred. Your source file has not been altered, but the copy process has been halted.
